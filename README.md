# Capstone-Red-Blue-Engagement
Capstone Engagement Assessment, Analysis, and Hardening of a Vulnerable System

Executive Summary

This report has been prepared for the purpose of identifying critical vulnerabilities on a network.

● The Red Team has been asked to identify and perform a penetration test scenario and operate as a
malicious hacker. This is a highly recommended approach to testing how the existing, or lack of
cybersecurity defenses perform.

● The red team will penetrate the system if possible as far as it will allow. The end objective will be
for them access restricted directories, download a token flag file as well as leave behind a reverse
TCP shell. This file will enable the attacker machine to remain in contact even after the hack is
complete and they have left the system.

● The Blue Team will then start by accessing system data logs which monitor network traffic.

● Once security breaches have been identified by the blue team, they will then outline critical
mitigation and hardening measures to increase security in the future.

● Blue team will recommend setting alerts based on typical usage thresholds. These alerts will offer
valuable insight into future malicious actions as well as the ability to react to security events in real
time.

● Hardening measures are then recommended to prevent future unwanted intrusions.
